### This was developed entirely on the built-in PHP 7.1.7 web server from Windows. 
To run server: 
```
$ cd <directory containing index.php>
$ php -S localhost:8000
```

### IMPORTANT 
The framework developed here was made entirely by me. I'm taking this course as an easy credit in my first semester at Concordia, but I have professional experience working in web development.

Here's my LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/phdumaresq/
And my GitHub: https://github.com/phdumaresq

All of the code 100% my own, besides the obvious importing of jQuery and Bootstrap for a handful of styles. The framework is based off of the .NET MVC framework, but without the use of controllers since it adds an extra layer of complexity that I didn't want to deal with for the sake of this assignment. 

In addition, on the Slack channel made by Catalin, I work to answer student's questions about the assignments and act as a resource for people in this class to use. 

Just wanted this disclaimer in the event of getting called out for plagarism since this is a little extra.
